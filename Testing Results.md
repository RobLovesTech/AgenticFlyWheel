To improve how the @SYSTEM_BOOTSTRAP.md  file is run.We need to figure out how to better launch it. To get it to work, I had to manually copy the prompt from @SYSTEM_BOOTSTRAP.md   into the AI agent to run it.

When I chose standard boot option 2, it asked me a series of questions. These should be self-answered by the AI agent going out and retrieving this information instead of asking the user for the information.

When I went through the initial AIP process and did the AIP lit process, I never got a reusable agent prompt in the AIP folder for the specific feature I was building. This prevents me from easily picking up where I left off. If my IDE crashes, because I need a prompt to resume our work, and that work needs to be understood dynamically by the agent, having the right prompt to go and understand where it left off and how to proceed and what the body of work is.

The agents.md file needs to be updated as part of the AIP setup process.
